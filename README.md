## About Project

ArtGL is an underdeveloping next generation advance webGL framework .

## Design

### easy and clear

As easy as threejs. You can regard this project as a better threejs, with better design and better code quality.

### extentable architecture

We make a general framework, not a specific renderer for specific usage, or a general renderer that hard to extent features. You can easily customize it to meet you real needs;

### support multiple levels of render abstraction

This is a facet of 'extentable', You can replace part of things like scene structure, muti pass structure by your own implementation;

### declaretive and powerful render pipline by renderGraph

Write a json like config for renderGraph, we handle all things. make multi pass rendering, add custom optimzer, tweaking effects, debug performence, more delightful. Make the whole render pipeline configurable.
